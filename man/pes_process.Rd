\arguments{
\item{cohort}{cohort for SSDQA testing; required fields:
\code{site} | \code{person_id} | \code{start_date} | \code{end_date} where start and end date}

\item{user_cutoff}{user selected number of days between events to be used
as a threshold cutoff for analyses}

\item{n_event_a}{the number of times event A should occur before establishing
the index date; defaults to 1}

\item{n_event_b}{the number of times event B should occur before establishing
the occurrence date; defaults to 1}

\item{pes_event_file}{CSV file with definitions of each of the events}

\item{multi_or_single_site}{direction to determine what kind of check to run
string that is either \code{multi} or \code{single}}

\item{anomaly_or_exploratory}{direction to determine what kind of check to run; a string
that is either \code{anomaly} or \code{exploratory}}

\item{age_groups}{If you would like to stratify the results by age group, fill out the provided \code{age_group_definitions.csv} file
with the following information:
- @min_age: the minimum age for the group (i.e. 10)
- @max_age: the maximum age for the group (i.e. 20)
- @group: a string label for the group (i.e. 10-20, Young Adult, etc.)

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{                Then supply this csv file as the age_groups argument (i.e. read.csv('path/to/age_group_definitions.csv'))

                If you would not like to stratify by age group, leave the argument as NULL
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{patient_level_tbl}{logical to define whether an intermediate table with
patient level output should be returned}

\item{p_value}{the p value to be used as a threshold in the multi-site anomaly detection analysis}

\item{time}{logical to determine whether to output the check across time}

\item{time_span}{when \code{time = TRUE}, a vector of two dates for the observation period of the study}

\item{time_period}{when time = TRUE, this argument defines the distance between dates within the specified time period. defaults
to \code{year}, but other time periods such as \code{month} or \code{week} are also acceptable}
