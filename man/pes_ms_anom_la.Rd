three graphs:
\enumerate{
\item line graph that shows the smoothed proportion of patients who meet the user provided threshold
of time between events across time with the Euclidean distance associated with each line
\item line graph that shows the raw proportion of patients who meet the user provided threshold
of time between events across time with the Euclidean distance associated with each line
\item a bar graph with the Euclidean distance value for each site, with the average
proportion as the fill
