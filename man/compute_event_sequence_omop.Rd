\usage{
compute_event_sequence_omop(
  cohort,
  grouped_list,
  site_col,
  user_cutoff = 30,
  n_event_a = 1,
  n_event_b = 1,
  patient_level_tbl = FALSE,
  time = FALSE,
  time_period = "year",
  time_span = c("2011-01-01", "2023-12-31"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort}{a table with the cohort of interest; should minimally include:
\itemize{
\item \code{site}
\item \code{person_id}
\item \code{start_date}
\item \code{end_date}
}}

\item{grouped_list}{list of columns in the data that should be used to group
the results}

\item{site_col}{the name of the column with site name(s)}

\item{user_cutoff}{a user specified threshold against which to measure the
number of days between the two events}

\item{n_event_a}{the number of times Event A should occur before establishing
the index date}

\item{n_event_b}{the number of times Event B should occur before esrablishing
the occurrence date}

\item{patient_level_tbl}{a logical to indicate whether an intermediate table with
patient level results should be output. if TRUE, a dataframe
with one row per patient will be returned in addition
to aggregate output}

\item{time}{a logical that tells the function whether you would like to look at the output over time}

\item{time_period}{when time = TRUE, this argument defines the distance between dates within the specified time period. defaults
to \code{year}, but other time periods such as \code{month} or \code{week} are also acceptable}

\item{time_span}{when time = TRUE, this argument defines the start and end dates for the time period of interest. should be
formatted as c(start date, end date) in yyyy-mm-dd date format.}

\item{event_csv}{a csv file with the definitions for each event with the columns
\itemize{
\item \code{event} - A or B
\item \code{event_label} - a descriptive label for the event
\item \code{domain_tbl} - the default CDM table from which data is retrieved
\item \code{concept_field} - the field in the table where the codes of interest are stored
\item \code{date_field} - the date field to be used to establish the index & occurrence dates
\item \code{codeset_name} - the name of the codeset in the specs directory to define the variable of interest
\item \code{filter_logic} - a string indicating any filter logic that should be applied to establish the event
ex: an Hba1c > 6.5
}}
}
\value{
an aggregated dataframe outlining the number of patients that had the two events
occur in X number of days

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{    if patient_level_tbl = TRUE, a patient level dataframe is also returned
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
