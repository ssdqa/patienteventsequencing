\arguments{
\item{cohort}{cohort for SSDQA testing; required fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{site}
\item \code{person_id}
\item \code{start_date}
\item \code{end_date}
}}

\item{user_cutoff}{user selected number of days between events to be used
as a threshold cutoff for analyses}

\item{n_event_a}{the number of times event A should occur before establishing
the index date; defaults to 1}

\item{n_event_b}{the number of times event B should occur before establishing
the occurrence date; defaults to 1}

\item{pes_event_file}{CSV file with definitions of each of the events}

\item{multi_or_single_site}{direction to determine what kind of check to run
string that is either \code{multi} or \code{single}}

\item{anomaly_or_exploratory}{direction to determine what kind of check to run; a string
that is either \code{anomaly} or \code{exploratory}}

\item{age_groups}{If you would like to stratify the results by age group,  create a table or CSV file with the following
columns and include it as the \code{age_groups} function parameter:
\itemize{
\item \code{min_age}: the minimum age for the group (i.e. 10)
\item \code{max_age}: the maximum age for the group (i.e. 20)
\item \code{group}: a string label for the group (i.e. 10-20, Young Adult, etc.)
}

If you would \emph{not} like to stratify by age group, leave the argument as NULL}

\item{patient_level_tbl}{logical to define whether an intermediate table with
patient level output should be returned}

\item{p_value}{the p value to be used as a threshold in the multi-site anomaly detection analysis}

\item{time}{logical to determine whether to output the check across time}

\item{time_span}{when \code{time = TRUE}, a vector of two dates for the observation period of the study}

\item{time_period}{when time = TRUE, this argument defines the distance between dates within the specified time period. defaults
to \code{year}, but other time periods such as \code{month} or \code{week} are also acceptable}
}
